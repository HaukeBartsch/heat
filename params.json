Subcortical gray matter is assumed to contain a large proportion of white matter as well and is assumed to belong to white matter for this simulation. Distance away from the ventricular spaces towards the cortical gray matter creates a measures that might be useful for the description of general white matter structures.\r\n\r\nThe heat program simulates a heat distribution using a discreet simulator (D3Q6). By specifying two distinct boundary temperatures one located at the ventricular spaces and one located at the cortical gray matter spaces the intermediate space can be relaxed to a state that shows a temperature gradient from hot to cold. Iso-temperature surfaces segment the white matter space into separate regions. The gradient of this potential field creates flow vectors that point towards gray matter.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
